### BG-34: Register remaining tab endpoints in `/api/_meta`

BG-31 shipped freshness coverage for `/api/status`, `/api/lifecycle`,
`/api/bandwidth`, `/api/aria2/{get_global_option,global_option,get_option,option}`,
`/api/log`, `/api/health`, `/api/version`, `/api/_meta`. Five GET endpoints
the frontend's per-tab loaders depend on are still unregistered, so the
`FreshnessRouter` cannot drive them and the LOADERS-manifest replacement
(FE-26) is blocked:

| Endpoint | Used by tab(s) | Suggested class | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/torrents` | Options | `warm`, `ttl_s: 30` | aria2 torrent listing |
| `GET /api/peers` | Options | `warm`, `ttl_s: 30` | local mDNS peers (also ties into FE-22) |
| `GET /api/downloads/archive` | Archive | `swr`, `ttl_s: 60` | accepts `?limit=` |
| `GET /api/sessions` | Log | `swr`, `ttl_s: 30` | accepts `?limit=` |
| `GET /api/declaration` | Dashboard, Bandwidth, Options, Log | `cold` or `warm` | static-ish; `loadDeclaration` is in every tab's LOADERS list at `k=12` today |

Also relevant for `revalidate_on` wiring:

- `POST /api/declaration` — should appear in `revalidate_on` of `GET /api/declaration`.
- `POST /api/declaration/preferences` — same.

**Desired:** Wrap each handler through `withMeta(method, path, body)` with
the per-endpoint freshness registration so they appear in `/api/_meta`
alongside the BG-31 set. Class choice is not load-bearing — the frontend
just needs *some* declared class so the router can pick a strategy. If
the backend prefers different classes than the suggestions above, that's
fine; please document the choice in `packages/api/src/freshness.ts`.

**Blocks frontend gap:** FE-26 (LOADERS replacement). Without
registration, those tabs would fall back to the legacy manifest while
the rest move to subscriptions — worst of both worlds.

**Priority:** medium. Frontend can ship FE-26 partially against the
registered subset, but the value (one consistent refresh model across
tabs) only lands when all loaders go through the router.

_End of open gaps._

## Explicit non-requests (do not implement)

| Topic | Decision | Reason |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Per-interface RX/TX byte counters | **Do not add** | Ariaflow is a download manager, not a network monitor. |
| Interface enumeration via API | **Do not add** | Exposes network topology. Frontend already has `local_identity()`. |

## Resolved

| ID | Summary | Date |
|----|---------|------|
| BG-33 | Legacy field aliases dropped from `/api/status`. `state.paused` removed from payload (kept as internal storage field only); `summary.stopped` mirror removed; `"stopped"` removed from `ITEM_STATUSES` and `TERMINAL_STATUSES` (in both `packages/core/src/queue/types.ts` and `packages/core/src/state/archivable.ts`). Canonical names are `dispatch_paused` (top-level + on `state`) and `removed`. Three negative-snapshot tests in `server.test.ts` assert no occurrence of `state.paused`, `summary.stopped`, or `status:"stopped"` in `/api/status` responses. Out-of-scope `"stopped"` strings (scheduler-loop reason, torrent `distribute_status`) intentionally left — they belong to other domains. `docs/STATE_MACHINE.md` updated | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-32 | Per-topic SSE subscriptions (v1: connect-time filter only). `GET /api/events?topics=items,scheduler` filters the stream; missing/empty → all topics (back-compat); unknown names → empty subset (typo ≠ firehose). `packages/api/src/event-topics.ts` is the single source for the 5 topics (items/scheduler/log/lifecycle/bandwidth) and the event→topic map (action_logged→log, session_*→scheduler, state_changed→items+scheduler, lifecycle_changed→lifecycle, bandwidth_probed→bandwidth); unknown event names fall through to all topics so a new emitter is visible until classified. `FreshnessMeta` extended with `transport_topics`; `/api/status` declares `["items","scheduler"]`, surfaces verbatim in `/api/_meta`. Mid-stream subscribe/unsubscribe deferred (reconnect with different `?topics=` is the v1 path). `packages/api/src/sse.md` documents the vocabulary | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-31 | Per-endpoint freshness contract. `packages/api/src/freshness.ts` is the single registry; `withMeta(method, path, body)` stamps the registered block and throws on unregistered keys. Initial coverage: `/api/status` (live, sse), `/api/lifecycle` (warm 30s, revalidate on `POST /api/lifecycle/:target/:action`), `/api/bandwidth` (on-action, revalidate on `POST /api/bandwidth/probe`), `/api/aria2/get_global_option` + `/api/aria2/global_option` (cold), `/api/log` (swr 10s), `/api/health`, `/api/version`, `/api/_meta` (all bootstrap). New `GET /api/_meta` returns the registry sorted by path. Validators: warm/swr require `ttl_s`, on-action requires `revalidate_on`, live requires `transport`; server test confirms `revalidate_on` triggers reference routes Fastify actually registered. `docs/FRESHNESS.md` mirrors the dashboard's design rationale | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-30 | Download state machine aligned on aria2's vocabulary. (1) `pollActiveItems` now persists `item.status="waiting"` (was only `live_status`). (2) `removed` added to `ITEM_STATUSES`/`TERMINAL_STATUSES`; poll emits canonical `removed` (was `stopped`); `/api/status.summary` mirrors `removed`/`stopped` as aliases. (3) `cancelled` removed from types/policy/`ITEM_STATUSES` — unreachable. (4) `/api/status` dual-keys `dispatch_paused` (top-level + on `state`) alongside legacy `state.paused`. (5) `state.active_gid`/`active_url` derived from `aria2.tellActive()` at `/api/status` read time, with stamped state as fallback when daemon unreachable. (6) `docs/STATE_MACHINE.md` documents the 8 states + transitions | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-29 | `/api/lifecycle` adds `expected_running` and `managed_by` (each `bool\|null` / enum-or-null) to every component's `result`. aria2: `expected_running = state.running \|\| state.active_gid \|\| any item in {queued,waiting,active}`; `managed_by` = `"launchd"` when the launchd plist exists on disk and aria2 is reachable, else `"external"` (or `null` when not running). ariaflow-server / networkquality / aria2-launchd carry `null` for both axes (informational rows) | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-28 | (a) `runSchedulerTick` stamps `state.active_gid`/`active_url` with the most recently dispatched item; `pollActiveItems` keeps state pointed at the live active row and clears both fields when nothing's in flight. (b) Poll mirrors aria2's camelCase tellStatus keys (`downloadSpeed`, `uploadSpeed`, `completedLength`, `totalLength`, `connections`, `numSeeders`) onto each row and now marks the row dirty so progress refreshes actually persist | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-27 | `/api/lifecycle` adds three orthogonal axes per component (`installed` / `current` / `running`, each `bool \| null`) alongside the BG-20 reason/outcome/message fields; `aria2.installed` from `findAria2c()`, `aria2.running` from RPC reachability; `aria2-launchd` keeps installed/current null and proxies running through aria2 RPC; `networkquality.current` is null (no version policy), running derived from a recent successful probe; `ariaflow-server.expected_version` added | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-26 | `/api/status.bandwidth` actually lifted now (full `state.last_bandwidth_probe` spread + `last_probe_at`); BG-25's earlier resolution shipped the code but the deploy was stale — verified live in tests | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-25 | Canonical `running` semantic = "scheduler loop is actively dispatching"; `POST /api/scheduler/{start,stop}` added, `/resume` auto-starts the loop when `running:false`, `state.running` flipped by `runSchedulerLoop` only; `/api/status` lifts a top-level `bandwidth` summary from `state.last_bandwidth_probe` so the dashboard Cap chip works without visiting the Bandwidth tab | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-24 | `/api/status.health` populated (uptime, requests/errors/bytes counters via Fastify hooks, sse_clients via /api/events subscribe/unsubscribe, disk_ok via statfsSync + checkDiskSpace); `/api/log` returns `{ok: true, items}` for envelope consistency | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-23 | cmdServe auto-resolves version from cli/package.json → pyproject.toml → __init__.py (skipping the 0.0.0 placeholder); /api/{status,lifecycle,version} now report the real release | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-22 | `/api/aria2/{get_global_option,global_option,get_option,option}` spread the aria2 keys at top level instead of wrapping under `options` | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-21 | `/api/bandwidth` lifts `interface_name`, `source`, `cap_mbps`, `current_limit` to top level (legacy `interface`/`cap_bytes_per_sec` kept as aliases) | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-20 | `/api/lifecycle` reshape: hyphen keys, `result` wrapper, aria2 + aria2-launchd records, recognized `reason` enum | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-19 | `/api/status` populates `ariaflow-server: {reachable, pid, version, error}` | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-18 | Backend announces `_ariaflow-server._tcp` via mDNS at startup (--no-mdns to disable) | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-17 | AGENTS.md gap-governance section documents file structure + cross-repo boundary | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-16 | `ariaflow-web` -> `ariaflow-dashboard` rename verified in AGENTS.md / README.md / AGENT.md / docs/GAPS.md | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-15 | TS port `discovery/parse.ts` already uses `_ariaflow-server._tcp` literally; legacy Python `discovery.py` not in TS ship path | 2026-04-30 |
| BG-14 | `archivable_count` exposed on `/api/status` summary | 2026-04-09 |
| BG-13 | WSL detection + default download dir to Windows filesystem | 2026-04-09 |
| BG-12 | Removed unused `/api/sessions/new` endpoint | 2026-04-09 |
